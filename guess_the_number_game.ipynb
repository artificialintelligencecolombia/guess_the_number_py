    "## Objective:\n",
    "Create a simple number guessing game where the computer generates a random number, and the player has to guess the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer should generate a random number between a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).\n",
    "The player should be prompted to enter their guess.\n",
    "After each guess, the computer should provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.\n",
    "The game should continue until the player guesses the correct number.\n",
    "The program should keep track of the number of attempts made by the player.\n",
    "Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: \n",
    "Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\n",
    "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\n",
    "Can you guess it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your guess: 50\n",
    "Too low! Try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your guess: 75\n",
    "Too high! Try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your guess: 63\n",
    "Too low! Try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your guess: 70\n",
    "Congratulations! You guessed the number in 4 attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the random module to generate a random number.\n",
    "2. Use a loop (e.g., while loop) to keep the game running until the player guesses the correct number.\n",
    "3. Consider using if, elif, and else statements to provide feedback on the player's guesses.\n",
    "4. You can use the input() function to get user input for the player's guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optional Enhancements:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you finds the exercise easy and wants to enhance the game, then you can consider adding the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Add a limit to the number of attempts the player can make before revealing the correct answer.\n",
    "6. Implement error handling for non-numeric input from the player.\n",
    "7. Allow the player to choose the range of numbers they want to guess from (e.g., 1 to 50 or 1 to 1000)."
